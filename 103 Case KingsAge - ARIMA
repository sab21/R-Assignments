#Kings data - forecasting age of king at the time of death

#Convert the data into time series format

help(ts)

#Plot time sereis data to check constant mean
ts.plot(kings)#No constant mean
plot(kingSeries)
mean(kingSeries)#55.28571
ts.plot(kingSeries)



#As mean is  not constant so we calculate Kingsseraies 2 with differences 1
kingSeries2<-diff(kingSeries,differences = 1)
plot(kingSeries2)
ts.plot(kingSeries2)
mean(kingSeries2)# -0.09756098 ~ 0
#So we can say the mean is constant among intervals so we go with kingseries2
#otherwise we have to go for more difference

#ARMA(p,d,q)
#correlogram acf
acf(kingSeries2)#q=1
# this will give q value; Here q = 1 (exclude the first one)
#no of lines crossing blue line is q (exclude first line)

acf(kingSeries2,lag.max = 20) 
acf(kingSeries2,plot=FALSE,lag.max = 20)
#as number of points above dotted blue line is 1, q=1

#partial correlogram pacf
pacf(kingSeries2) # p = 3 (Don't exclude any one)
#this will give p value
#no of lines crossing blue line is p
pacf(kingSeries2,lag.max=20)
#as number of points above dotted line is 3, p=3



#ARIMA model is combination of two models - AR and MA
#ARIMA model has three arguments (p,d,q)
#p - partial corrologram
#d= difference to make mean constant
#q -  corrrologram
#AR - auto regressive model (p,d) here q is assumed as 0
#MA - moving average model  (d,q) here p is assumed as 0

#So for KingSeries2
#Here p = 3,q=1, d= 1(as difference = 1 is taken) for king time series
#Best model is whose sum of arguments is least.
#ARIMA(3,1,1) - 5
#AR(3,1,0)   - 4
#MA(0,1,1)   - 2 - MA Model Selected

# a model whose sum of argument is least will be selected
#Moving average model is selected

#For Automatic calculation of (p d q)

library(forecast)

auto.arima(kings)#order= (0,1,1)

#ARIMA(p,d,q) where parameters p, d, and q are non-negative integers, 
#p is the order (number of time lags) of the autoregressive model, 
#d is the degree of differencing (the number of times the data have had past values subtracted),
#and q is the order of the moving-average model.

#X_t - mu = Z_t - (theta * Z_t-1), 
#where X_t is the stationary time series we are studying (the first differenced series of
#ages at death of English kings), mu is the mean of time series X_t, 
#Z_t is white noise with mean zero and constant variance, and 
#theta is a parameter that can be estimated.

#Building Model
KingsModel <- arima(kingSeries, order=c(0,1,1))

#model validation
ts.plot(KingsModel$residuals) # make time plot of forecast errors
#a constant residual value makes model acceptable
#here residual has constant mean
mean(pred_res$residuals)#0.9712931

#make a correlogram of the forecast errors for our ARIMA(0,1,1) model for the ages at
#death of kings, and perform the Ljung-Box test for lags 1-20
acf(pred_res$residuals, lag.max=20)

#box.test is used to test residual =0
#Let
#H0: residual-0, H1: Residual not = 0
Box.test(KingsModel$residuals,lag = 20, type = "Ljung-Box")
# p-value = 0.8509 ie p >0.05 So we cannot reject H0
#So we accept H0 ie residual is equal to 0

#So We accept the kingsModel

#Time Series Analysis Using ARIMA Model
#Time Series is used to foreast a numeric variables based on date.
#Here dependent variable is numeric variables and independent variable is date

#There are few pre-requiste before apply ARIMA on data
#1. Transform data into Time series format - use ts()
#2. Data should have constant mean value or mean =0 - use diff()
#3. There should not be any seasonal effect on data -  use decompose()

#In case of seasonal effect we have to decompose it and subtract seasonal effect from data
