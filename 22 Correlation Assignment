# Case: Smoking and Longevity
# A study is designed to check the relationship between smoking and longevity. 
# A sample of 40 men was taken and the average number of cigarettes smoked per day 
# and the age at death was recorded and presented in the excel file smokings.xlsx. 
# 1.	Can we conclude from the sample that longetivity is independent of smoking?
# 2.	Based on the given scenario formulate your null and alternative hypothesis.
# 3.	Find the correlation between cigarettes and longevity?  And draw your own conclusion.
# 
# Questions -
#   1.	What is the key difference between cor(x,y) and cor(data)?
#   2.	Interpret a correlation of -0.25 between the variables A and B.

#H1(Alternative Hypothesis): There is some correlation between them

#Since P value is less than .05 there fore we can reject Null Hypothesis
#with given data and conclude that there is correlation between

r=cor(data$cigarettes,data$longetivity);r
#r=-0.58 means strong negative coreelation is there between smking and longetivity
#i.e. more smoking can leads to less longetivity

#Q1
#cor(x,y) gives the by default pearson r value by default  between x y
#cor(data) gives the correlation matrix for all the column against each column
#present in the matrix

#Q2
#cor(a,b); r=-.25
#Very weak negative correlation is there between a and b
