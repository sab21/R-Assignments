# 1. Create a dataframe WeatherData containing the following columns.
# Date: Dates from 1st January 2017 to 10th January 2017.
# Temperature: 32,35,28,24,32,31,43,23,34,34
# WindSpeed: 6,7,2,7,4,2,3,7,5,6
# Event: Rain, Sunny, Snow, Snow, Rain, Sunny, Sunny, Rain, Sunny, Sunny
WeatherData<-data.frame(Date=seq(as.Date("1/1/2017","%d/%m/%Y"),
                                 as.Date("10/1/2017","%d/%m/%Y"),1),
                        Temperature=c(32,35,28,24,32,31,43,23,34,34),
                        WindSpeed=c(6,7,2,7,4,2,3,7,5,6),
                        Event=c("Rain", "Sunny", "Snow", "Snow", "Rain", "Sunny", 
                              "Sunny", "Rain", "Sunny", "Sunny"))

WeatherData
# a. View only first three records of WeatherData
head(WeatherData,3)
# b. Find the column names and the dimension of WeatherData.
colnames(WeatherData)
str(WeatherData)
dim(WeatherData)

# c. Extract the records in which the Event is Sunny and store it in 
#another data frame SunnyEvent
SunnyEvent<-subset(WeatherData,Event=="Sunny")

# d. Find the average of Temperature of all Rain Event.
mean(subset(WeatherData,Event=="Rain")$Temperature)#29

# 2. Create a dataframe SalesReport containing the following columns.
# ProductID: A_101, A_102,.........A_110
# ProductCategory: A and B for the alternate rows
# Unitprice: random integer values between 200 and 300
# Quantity: random integer values between 10 and 20
SalesReport<-data.frame(ProductID=paste0("A_",101:110),
                        ProductCategory=c("A","B"),
                        Unitprice=as.integer(runif(10,200,300)),
                        Quantity=round(runif(10,10,20),0))
View(SalesReport)

# a. Find the number of rows and number of columns of SalesReport dataframe.
nrow(SalesReport)
ncol(SalesReport)
# b. Create a new column Price which is the product of Unitprice and Quantity.
SalesReport<-cbind(SalesReport,Price=SalesReport$Unitprice*SalesReport$Quantity)
SalesReport

# c. Find the average sales for each ProductCategory.
aggregate(SalesReport$Price,list(SalesReport$ProductCategory),mean)

# d. Find the number of sales for each ProductCategory.
with(SalesReport,(aggregate(Quantity,list(ProductCategory),sum)))

# 3. Create a dataset Advertising in R using advertising.csv. 
#Perform correlation test on Radio and Sales, Newspaper and Sales and 
#interpret the results.

data<-read.csv("C:/Users/acer/Desktop/R Class Assignment/Test/R module test 2/advertising.csv")
View(data)
attach(data)
#Assumption:  H0(Null Hypothesis) - There is  no Correlation between Radio and Sales
#             H1(Alternative Hypothesis) - There is Correlation between Radio and Sales
cor(Radio,Sales)#r=0.5762226: strong positive correlation
cor.test(Radio, Sales)#P-Value<.05
#Since P-value is less than 0.05 therefore we REJECT H0 and conclude that
#theres is correlation between Radio and Sales
#From r=0.58 it can concluded that with increase in Radio there is increase in Sales

#Assumption:  H0(Null Hypothesis) - There is  no Correlation between Newspaper and Sales
#             H1(Alternative Hypothesis) - There is Correlation between Newspaper and Sales
cor(Newspaper,Sales)#r=0.228299: Weak positive correlation
cor.test(Newspaper, Sales)#p-value = 0.001148
#Since P-value is less than 0.05 therefore we REJECT H0 and conclude that
#theres is correlation between Radio and Sales
#From r=0.23 it can concluded that with increase in Radio there is increase in Sales
#but the correlation is very weak

#So we can conclude that impact of Radio over Newspaper is more in terms of Sales


# 4. Using the Advertising dataframe build a regression analysis model to predict 
#Sales using the variable TV. Test the significance of the test as well.

#Regression
#Assume that the data is random and unformly distributed
plot(density(TV))
plot(density(Sales))
#Linearity
plot(TV,Sales)#Data is leniar
#Missing Value
any(is.na(data))#FALSE
#Outlier
boxplot(TV,Sales)#No Outlier

#Build Model
mod<-lm(Sales~TV)
# 
# Assume that the error term ϵ in the linear regression model is independent of x, and is 
# normally distributed, with zero mean and constant variance. We can decide whether there is 
# any significant relationship between x and y by testing the null hypothesis that β = 0.
summary(mod)
#R-squared:  0.6119
#p-value: < .05

#As the p-value is much less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that β = 0. 
#Hence there is a significant relationship between the variables in the 
#linear regression model of the data.

#But since r-Squared value is less than 0.7 there fore it cannot be 
#taken as good fit model

mod$coefficients
# Intercept)          TV 
# 7.03259355  0.04753664 
#Equation:Sales=7.03+.0475*TV
