# rotate we do to find out which variable will contribute in which factor
#By looking at our factor loadings, we can begin to assess our factor 
#solution. We can see that BIO, GEO, and CHEM all have high factor 
#loadings around 0.8 on the first factor (PA1). Therefore, we might call
#this factor Science and consider it representative of a student's 
#interest in science subject matter. Similarly, ALG, CALC, and STAT load 
#highly on the second factor (PA2), which we might call Math.
#Note that STAT has a much lower loading on PA2 than ALG or CALC and 
#that it has a slight loading on factor PA1. This suggests that statistics
#is less related to the concept of Math than algebra and calculus. Just 
#below the loadings table, we can see that each factor accounted for 
#around 30% of the variance in responses, leading to a factor solution 
#that accounted for 66% of the total variance in students' subject matter
#preference. Lastly, notice that our factors are correlated at 0.21 and 
#recall that our choice of oblique rotation allowed for the recognition 
#of this relationship.
#Of course, there are many other considerations to be made in developing
#and assessing an EFA that will not be presented here.

#When to use factor analysis
#1. To reduce number variable - if variables are correlated
#2. To test our assumption related to variables - Principal component analysis
#3. To remove multicollinearity in regression or model regression
#multicollinearity  will exit if independent varibales are correlated
