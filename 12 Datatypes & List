#Datatype Assignement 4th Aug 2019
# 
# # 1. Create two numeric values with name num1 and num2; assign values as 20.752 
#   and 25.625 respectively.
# # 2. Create a character value with name company and assign value as 
#   “NIKHIL ANALYTICS”; convert first letter of both words into upper case 
#   and rest should be lower case.
# # 3. Find addition of num1 and num2 of question1, and store result of 
#   addition into a new variable as integer.
# # 4. Create two complex values with name com1 and com2, and assign 
#   values as 5-4i and 5+4i. Find the product of com1 and com2. Can we 
#   store result of product as integer?
# # 5. Which function is used to find type of a variable? Can we add two 
#     different type of variables like numeric and complex, give some examples.


#1
num1=20.752
num2<-20.625

is.numeric(num1)
is.numeric(num2)

#2
company<-"NIKHIL ANALYTICS"
is.character(company)
paste0(substr(company,1,1),tolower(substr(company,2,6)),
       substr(company,7,8),tolower(substr(company,9,17)))


pos<-regexpr(pattern = " ",company)
pos[1]
paste0(substr(company,1,1),tolower(substr(company,2,pos[1]-1)),
       substr(company,pos[1],8),tolower(substr(company,pos[1]+1,nchar(company))))


#3
(new_var<-as.integer(num1+num2))
is.integer(new_var)

#4
comp1<-5-4i
comp2<-5+4i
comp3<-as.integer(comp1*comp2);comp3
#yes we can store the resut as integer since it doesnot contain any imaginary part
#in case of complex no it can be converted to integer by dicarding imaginary part

#5
class(comp1)
#class() is used to know the type of datatype
#Yes we can add two diff variable like in case of addition of complex and numeric ]
#datatypes numeric part will be added with real part of complex no. 
#But the data type of the result will become complex
(d1<-comp1+num1);class(d1)
#Similarly in case of numeric and integer addition the result will be numeric
(d2<-new_var+num1);class(d2)
#Logical TRUE FALSE will be converted to numeric 1 & 0 resp and the operation will be performed
(d3<-new_var+T);class(d3)
#Whereas addition of character data with numeric, complex integer or logical is not possible


#LIST Assignment
# # 1. Create a list which include 4 elements in it, 1st element is vector with 
#   values 1 to 10, 2nd element is vector with two values “Yes” and “No”, 
#   3rd element is vector of logical value TRUE and FALSE, 4th element is 
#   vector of 5 numeric values (1,1,1,2,2,2).
# # 2. Create a list which include 9 elements each elements have prime factor of 
#   2 to 10.
# # 3. Create a list with element name “A”,”B”,”C”. A has value from 100 to 200, 
#   B has value as letters a, b ,c and C has value as matrix of 10 values 
#   from 1 to 10 with 2 column.
# # 4. Create a list with name “India.Movies” with two elements – first element
#   is vector movies.name and have three values 
#   (take some movies name of your own choice), second element is vector 
#   Revenue and have three values like 2.3,4.5,5,6
