# 1. What are data types in R? Mention any four data types with examples. (Marks-5)
#Ans: Datatype of a value is an attribute that specifies which type of value of a
#variable has.
# Datatypes are basic character of data. In R it need not have to be defined exclusively
#R's basic data types are character, numeric, integer, complex, and logical. 
#R's basic data structures include the vector, list, matrix, data frame, and factors.
#   1. Numeric (Any numerical value is by default numeric)
num1<-4.2
#   2. Integer (Non decimal numeric value)
num2<-as.integer(2.8);num2
#  3. Character: Chararcter value are stored in string and it must within quotes
char1<-"Nikhil Analytics"
#   4.Complex: Here imaginary number are stored where i^2 = -1
num3<-5+3i
#5. Logical
m=5<4;m;class(m)

# 2. a) How to find the data type of a given object in R? (Marks-2.5)
#Ans
#class function is used to determine the type of given object
class(num3)
# b) Convert the numeric vector (1, 2, 3) into character (Marks-2.5)
#Ans
v1<-c(1,2,3)
class(v1)
v1_as_character<-as.character(v1)

# 3. Form a vector with first 10 multiples of 3 and name each element of the vector (Marks-5)
#Ans
v3<-seq(3,,3,10)
v3
names(v3)<-paste0("V",1:10);v3

# 4. Write the methods for accessing elements from vector. Give examples.(Marks-5)
# Ans:
# Extracting element from vector can be done by indexing or from its name
# Square bracket is used to extract element. Indexing starts from 1
# Example:
  v3[1] #display 1st
  v3[1:5]#display 1st to 5th Value
  v3[-5] #Display except 5th Value
  v3["V5"]#display value having name V5

# 5. Create a matrix Player_stats using the following data (Marks-10)
# Total Run Player age
# Rohit Sharma 6424 30
# Virat Kohli 9030 29
# M S Dhoni 9898 36
player_stats<-matrix(c(6424,30,9030,29,9898,36),3,2, byrow = T)
dimnames(player_stats) = list(c("Rohit Sharma","Virat Kohli","M S Dhoni"),
                              c("Total Runs","Age"))
  
# a) For the above matrix add the details of three more players.
# Jadeja 1914 29
# Ashwin 675 31
# Suresh Raina 5568 31 
new_player<-matrix(c(1914,29,675,31,5568,31),3,2, byrow = T,
                   dimnames = list(c("Jadeja","Ashwin","Suresh Raina"),
                                   c("Total Runs","Age")))
new_player
(new_player_stats<-rbind(player_stats,new_player))

# b) Add a new column Strike_rate to the above matrix.
# Strike_rate
# 87.08
# 91.73
# 88.46
# 85.29
# 86.98
# 93.77
strike_rate<-c(87.08,91.73,88.46,85.29,86.98, 93.77)

(new_player_stats<-cbind(new_player_stats,strike_rate))

# c) Extract the details of M S Dhoni from the Player_stats matrix.
new_player_stats[3,];new_player_stats["M S Dhoni",]

# d) Extract the age and Strike rate of all the players.
new_player_stats[,2:3]

# e) Find the mean of the runs scored by all the players.
(colMeans(new_player_stats))
mean_all<-apply(new_player_stats,2,mean)
mean_run<-mean_all[1]

# 6. Write a function to find the square root of a given number and round it to 
#   2 decimal places. (Marks-5)
find_sqrt<-function(num){
  num=round(sqrt(num),2)
  return(num)
}
find_sqrt(2)


# 7. Write a function to convert first, third and last character of given name into
# uppercase and rest should be in lowercase. (Marks-5)


upper_1st_3rd_last_char<-function(name) {
  name=paste0(toupper(substr(name,1,1)),tolower(substr(name,2,2)),toupper(substr(name,3,3)),
              tolower(substr(name,4,nchar(name)-1)),toupper(substr(name,nchar(name),nchar(name))))
  return(name)
}
upper_1st_3rd_last_char("Sabyasachi SAHU")

# 8. Create a list with name example_list 
# Values of even numbers from 1 to 20. B has a matrix with 3 rows and 
#   3 columns with numbers 1 to 9. C contains a list of vowels. (Marks-5)
example_list<-list("A"=seq(2,20,2),
                   "B"=matrix(1:9,3,3),
                   "C"=c("A","E","I","O","U"))
example_list

# a) Extract first two elements from the above list.
example_list[1:2]
# b) Extract 4th 
example_list$A[4]
